    <!-- Good practice is to keep the HTML file name as index.html so that when you will hosting your web application, hosting
            platfrom needs tofigure out which is the landing page or first page of you website -->


    <!-- Script file exists in the day-1 folder, index.html does not know, we need it to know so we will be adding it in the bottom of the page inside body tag -->

    <!-- We can write JS code inside HTML file, but it is not preferable or good practice to follow.. -->


    <!-- 1st way of adding JS file  -->
    <!-- <script>
        console.log(4 + 4)
    </script> -->


    <!-- We have linked our js file here  -->

    <!-- We can add script tag in both head and body tag, however it is a good practice to write script tag inside body so that your HTML content loads first and Javascript content afterwards -->
    <script src="./script.js"></script>

    <!-- src = source  -->
